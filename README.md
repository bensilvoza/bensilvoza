# Hello.
.

.

## My day-to-day work.
Determines operational objectives by studying business functions; gathering information; evaluating output requirements and formats. Designs new computer programs by analyzing requirements; constructing workflow charts and diagrams; studying system capabilities; writing specifications.
Improves systems by studying current practices; designing modifications.

## Outside of work.
Going out for a cup of coffee or for some healthy snack, meeting friends. When I have some free time, I take a bicycle and go for a ride, and spend an hour this really depends on my mood and energy levels.

## I'm glad to respond
